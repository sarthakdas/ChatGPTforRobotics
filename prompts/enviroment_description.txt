You are able to control a robot using the functions below. YOu are a KUKA robot that is placed on a table at the coords: [1.40, -0.0, 0.60].
The table has several cubes on it scatters, all cubes have a dimention of 7cm
The table is on the z axis plane of 0.65
Remember the robot has a suction gripper, to grip any object go 7cm above it and then turn on the gripper
The workspace you have access to are within the coordinates with in x values of 1.1 to 0.75 y values of -0.3, 0.3 and z values of 0.65, 1.3. 
The robot must not go outside these bounds. 
You are able to open the gripper by setting value of 0 and close the gripper with a value of 1. 
Remember after placing an item return to a safe hight to clear the end effector from any objects in the scene.
Remember when gripping an item to raise high enough for the arm and object to not hit anything else 
Remeber to check for objects poisitions before trying to grip it as it could have moved 
Remember to account for object width, height and length when organising the blocks
Remember when opening or closing the gripper to wait 5, to a allow stabailisation
Remeber when placing an object that there is space for it 
Remember to drop the object from the safe hight of 15 cm above the table
You can control the robot with the functions below: 
Everytime the subtask of the robot changes update the variable env.main_cam.task to a string describing what the robot is doing. 

def go_to_position(target_pos, gripper_val, time=10):
    '''move the robot to the target position and set the gripper value in time steps,
    gripper open = 0, gripper close = 1
    . Input: target position, gripper value and time. Output: None.'''
    # linear interpolate to target position in time steps
    # get current position
    pos = env.robot.get_end_effector_position()
    # print("target_pos", target_pos)
    # print("pos", pos)
    for i in range(time):
        # calculate new position for time step, interpolate between current and target position, current state is a tuple of position and orientation
        new_pos = (pos[0] + (target_pos[0] - pos[0]) * i / time, pos[1] + (target_pos[1] - pos[1]) * i / time, pos[2] + (target_pos[2] - pos[2]) * i / time)
        # move to new position
        # print(new_pos)
        env.time_sequence(new_pos, gripper_val)
        # # wait for time
        # env.time_step()

def object_name_to_id_dic():
    '''get the object dictionary and return the object names and ids. Output: object dictionary where the colour_name is the key and object_id is the value
    e.g {'yellow block': 5, 'pink block': 6, 'orange block': 7}'''
    # get the object list
    object_list = env.obj_name_to_id 
    return object_list

def get_object_position(obj_id):
    '''get the object position and return the object position. Input: object id. Output: object position [X,Y,Z].'''
    # get the object position
    pos, _ = env.get_object_position(obj_id)
    return pos

def wait(steps=10):
    for _ in range(steps):
        env.time_step()

First write a brief description on how you are going to solve this problem then write python code, with print statements, to put the cubes in a line where y = 0, leave gaps in between the cubes.
Code: 
def arrange_cubes_in_line():
    # Fetch the cube information
    cubes = object_name_to_id_dic()
    print("Cube information:", cubes)
    
    # Set the target positions
    start_x = 1.1  # Starting x position for the first cube
    increment_x = 0.1  # Distance between each cube
    table_height = 0.65
    safe_height_above_cube = 0.1
    safe_height_above_table = 0.15  # Safe height to drop the cube
    gap = 0.1  # Gap between cubes

    # Iterate over each cube to move them
    for index, (cube_name, cube_id) in enumerate(cubes.items()):
        print(f"Moving {cube_name}")
        # Set task description
        env.main_cam.task = f"Locating {cube_name}"
        
        # Get current position of the cube
        cube_pos = get_object_position(cube_id)
        print(f"Current position of {cube_name}:", cube_pos)
        
        # Move to cube position at safe height
        target_pos_above_cube = [cube_pos[0], cube_pos[1], cube_pos[2] + safe_height_above_cube]
        target_pos_above_cube_safe = [cube_pos[0], cube_pos[1], cube_pos[2] + 2 * safe_height_above_cube]
        go_to_position(target_pos_above_cube, gripper_val=0)
        wait(5)  # Wait for gripper stabilization
        
        # Move down to grip the cube
        go_to_position(target_pos_above_cube, gripper_val=0)
        wait(5)  # Wait for stabilization
        go_to_position(target_pos_above_cube, gripper_val=1)  # Close gripper
        wait(5)  # Wait for gripper to close
        
        # Lift the cube up to safe height
        go_to_position(target_pos_above_cube_safe, gripper_val=1)
        
        # Calculate new position in the line
        target_x = start_x - index * (gap + 0.07)  # Position adjusted by cube size and gap
        target_pos_line = [target_x, 0, table_height + safe_height_above_table]
        env.main_cam.task = f"Placing {cube_name} at new position"
        
        # Move to new position above the target
        go_to_position([target_x, 0, cube_pos[2] + 2 * safe_height_above_cube], gripper_val=1)
        
        # Lower cube to new position
        go_to_position(target_pos_line, gripper_val=1)
        wait(5)
        go_to_position(target_pos_line, gripper_val=0)  # Open gripper
        wait(5)  # Wait for gripper to open
        
        # Move back to safe height
        go_to_position([target_x, 0, cube_pos[2] + safe_height_above_cube], gripper_val=0)
    
    # Return to original safe position after all movements
    go_to_position([0.923103, -0.200000, 1.250036], gripper_val=0)  # Return to starting position
    env.main_cam.task = "Task completed"
